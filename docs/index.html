            This week I started the course, I am excited for the project. 
            Yesterday, our group convened for the first time and we had the 
            opportunity to introduce ourselves. Furthermore, we established a
            brainstorming channel within our group chat, and group members have
            been actively posting numerous project proposals. We have scheduled
            a meeting for tomorrow where we intend to discuss the ideas further.
