            This week I started the course, I am excited for the project. 
            Yesterday, our group convened for the first time and we had the 
            opportunity to introduce ourselves. Furthermore, we established a
            brainstorming channel within our group chat, and group members have
            been actively posting numerous project proposals. We have scheduled
            a meeting for tomorrow where we intend to discuss the ideas further.

            This week we had a lecture about the game design document(GDD). It should contain a
            concept description, a technical description, target group, business plan. With 
            the different points you should have a motivation and market analysis.

            The GDD is a living document and should be updated as the project progresses.
            A takeaway from the lecture is that we should have a name for the game since it
            will give the game an identity. So I will push for getting a name for the game.

            Next week we will have the project pitch so we will have a meeting on Thuesday to
            decide on a game idea and start working on the presentation.

            This week we worked on the game concept. We decided on a game where you play as a cyborg
            and you have to fight Robots and steal their parts to upgrade yourself. The game will be
            in orthographic top down view. We also decided on a name for the game, it will be called 
            TechnoScourge: Rise of the Adaptive.<br><br>

            I created a unity project with a basic scene and a player controller. I added a character
            that can move around with a top down view and orthographic camera. I also started doing 
            some 3d animation. Other group members have been working on concept art. Some have been
            using AI art and some have been drawing by hand. <br><br>

            Next week we will work on the early demo. I will continue to work on movement and animation. I 
            will also work on the texturing of the character. Bellow is a cool logo for the game created by
            another group member and the super early demo created by me. <br>
